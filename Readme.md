# Spring AI

## What is Spring AI?

Spring AI makes it easy to use **Artificial Intelligence (AI) models** inside **Spring Boot applications**.

- Helps developers (especially Spring developers) integrate AI models into their apps.
- Enables adding AI features without complex setup.
- Provides an **abstraction layer** between your app and AI models (so you don’t need to learn each provider’s API separately).
- Lets you call AI models just like calling a normal **REST API in Spring**.
- Works with multiple providers (OpenAI, Azure, Hugging Face, Ollama, Amazon Bedrock, etc.) with very little code change.
- Supports advanced AI concepts like **prompts**, **embeddings**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, and **chat history** in a simple, structured way.
